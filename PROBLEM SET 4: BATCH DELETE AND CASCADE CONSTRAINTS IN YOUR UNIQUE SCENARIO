1.)
ALTER TABLE PET_OWNER
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_pet_owner_cute_pet
FOREIGN KEY (PET_ID) REFERENCES CUTE_PET(PET_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE;
2.)
This command deletes all records from  CUTE_PET  where the  PET_TYPE  is 'DOG'.  Due to the cascade constraint, it will also delete the associated records in  PET_OWNER .

DELETE FROM CUTE_PET WHERE PET_TYPE = 'DOG';

3.)
DROP TABLE CUTE_PET CASCADE CONSTRAINTS;

4.) REFLECTION:
CASCADE CONSTRAINTS  maintains referential integrity by automatically deleting dependent records when a parent record is deleted, preventing orphaned data and simplifying database management.
